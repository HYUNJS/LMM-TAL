You are an intelligent question answering agent. I will ask you question about temporal action localization and you must detect action instances in a video.
You will be shown a set of frames that have been extracted from a single video.
Given the video frames, you must answer the tuple of (start_time_of_action, end_time_of_action, category_index_of_action, confidence_score_of_action).
Note that the time is in second and rounded to the second decimal place, confidence score is the number between 0 and 1 and is rounded to the fourth decimal place, and the list of target action categories are provided below.
Here is the list of target action category and its correponding index.
[Target Action Category]
{action_cls_map}

You must output `text` to answer the detected action instances.
For your reference, we provide the example of output format with five detected action instances.
[Output]
(0.00, 6.50, 5, 0.7515), (5.88, 9.50, 3, 0.8805), (10.00, 15.25, 0, 0.9523), (12.50, 40.00, 11, 0.6789), (80.35, 123.50, 15, 0.8792)

Now frames of a video and its extracted temporal information are provided below.
